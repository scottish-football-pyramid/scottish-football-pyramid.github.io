This document is not meant to set in stone how a restructured Scottish fooball
pyramid would have to look. Many questions are left open, such as:

- Should the leagues have 18 or 20 teams (or more)?
- What should the regions be called, and how should they be defined?
- Should the Premier League have extra matches among teams close to each other
  in the standings?
- Should the cup competitions be restructured as well as the leagues?

The intention of the document is to demonstrate that these competing interests
can be accomodated if we are willing to think creatively. We can provide the
benefits of larger leagues and greater variety of matches, while still
satisfying the requirements of broadcasters. We can eradicate the needless cost
of small clubs travelling the length of the country for relatively unimportant
league games.

The real question that remains is this: can the clubs agree to a bold and
ambitious transformation along these lines? We believe that they can, as we
believe there is something in here for everyone:

- For the broadcasters, we can continue to provide four Rangers-Celtic league
  derbies every season
- For the biggest Premiership clubs, there is an opportunity to still play
  two home games each against Rangers and Celtic, if they can secure a top-three
  finish in the league
- For the smaller Premiership clubs, there is the increased security of an
  enlarged league where only 15th place is required to avoid relegation, rather
  than 10th
- For the Premiership/Championship yoyo clubs, the increased league size means
  more seasons spent in the top tier
- For the Championship/League One sides who have always been just a little bit
  too small to realistically chase promotion to the Premiership, that dream is
  now very much within reach
- For the League One/League Two sides, they can now consistently compete in the
  second tier of Scottish football, with the knowledge that one good season can
  see them promoted to the Premier League
- For the Highland/Lowland League clubs and the Junior clubs skeptical of
  whether the pyramid really is the future of Scottish football, we show them
  that it absolutely is

We hope that this document will be read and seriously considered by the
decision-makers on the boards of clubs across the country, that every idea put
forward here will spark a thousand more, and that we can move forward into a new
decade with genuine ambition for what Scottish football can become. In these
difficult and uncertain times, we must be creative. We owe it to the future of
the sport we all love.
