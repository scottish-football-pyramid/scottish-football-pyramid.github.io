Suppose we were to put this structure in place for the 2020/21 season, based off
of the current standings in the SPFL (and Highland League). What would that look
like?


### Premier League

The following teams would compete in the new Premier League, in addition to the
existing 12 Premiership clubs:

- Dundee United
- Inverness Caledonian Thistle
- Dundee
- Ayr United
- Arbroath
- Dunfermline

If the decision was made to include extra matches between teams who finished
close to each other in the previous season, then there could be an extra two
matches between each pair of teams in the following sets of three:

- Celtic, Rangers, Motherwell
- Aberdeen, Livingston, St Johnstone
- Hibernian, Kilmarnock, St Mirren
- Ross County, Hamilton Academical, Heart of Midlothian
- Dundee United, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Dundee
- Ayr United, Arbroath, Dunfermline

If we assume that the final league table ends up the same as their present
standing, then Ayr United, Arbroath and Dunfermline would be automatically
relegated. Arbroath would go into the Northern League for the following season,
while Ayr United and Dunfermline would go into the Southern League.


### Southern League

The inaugural season of the Southern League would be contested between the
following 18 clubs:

- Greenock Morton
- Alloa Athletic
- Queen of the South
- Partick Thistle
- Raith Rovers
- Falkirk
- Airdrieonians
- East Fife
- Dumbarton
- Clyde
- Stranraer
- Edinburgh City
- Cowdenbeath
- Queen's Park
- Stirling Albion
- Annan Athletic
- Stenhousemuir
- Albion Rovers

If the final league table reflected the current standings, then Greenock Morton
would gain automatic promotion as champions, while Alloa Athletic and Queen of
the South would go into a promotion playoff. Annan Athletic, Stenhousemuir and
Albion Rovers would be relegated.


### Northern League

The following clubs would be placed in the new Northern League:

- Montrose
- Peterhead
- Forfar Athletic
- Cove Rangers
- Elgin City
- Brechin City
- Brora Rangers
- Inverurie Loco Works
- Fraserburgh
- Rothes
- Buckie Thistle
- Formartine United
- Forres Mechanics
- Nairn County
- Keith
- Wick Academy
- Deveronvale
- Huntly

If the final league table ended up in that order, then Montrose would be
automatically promoted as champions, while Peterhead and Forfar Athletic would
go into a promotion playoff. Wick Academy, Deveronvale and Huntly would be
relegated.


### Promotion Playoffs

This would be contested between Alloa Athletic and Queen of the South from the
Southern League, and Peterhead and Forfar Athletic from the Northern League. We
might expect this to be won by Alloa Athletic, as the team currently highest in
the SPFL table. In this case both the Northern and Southern Leagues would need
three teams to be promoted in from below, as they would each have had the same
number of teams relegated in as promoted out.

No playoff would be required between 1st-placed teams and 3rd-placed teams from
the third tier. It is an open question whether this means they would be
cancelled, or if they would be played in advance in any case just in case they
are needed. The 2nd-placed teams from the two Northern Leagues and from the two
Southern Leagues would play each other to determine who should be promoted into
the second tier.
