<h1>Scottish Football Pyramid Proposal</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic creates an impossible task for Scottish football
administrators - how do we end the season fairly? How can we ensure that no club
finds itself in a lower tier than it was hoping to be in at the conclusion of
the 2019/20 season? Within the current league structure, there is no right
answer to this question.</p>
<p>But what if we restructure? What if we implement a structure where every single
club ends up in the highest tier they could possibly have hoped for? Clearly, we
cannot do this without enlarging the leagues. A 14 or 16 team top league has
been talked about, but this is an uninspiring compromise which fails to satisfy
fans who for years have been begging for a structure which gives just two games
a season against each team in their league. We should take this opportunity to
go further, to tackle the deeper structural problems within our game.</p>
<p>We propose that there should be only one national league - a top tier of 18
clubs. Below this, the second tier would split into Northern and Southern
Divisions of a similar size. Our current structure of four national leagues is
modelled on the English system, but we have neither enough people nor enough
viable professional clubs to sustain this.</p>
<p>In the past decade, Annan Athletic have played 40 matches against Elgin City.
This involves a 514-mile round trip for the away club and their supporters. For
clubs whose average attendances are in the region of 500, this is a needless
expense, with no other purpose than to prop up the current league structure.</p>
<p>There's a reason why local derbies are a thing - the short distances allow for
large away crowds and intense atmospheres. It's hard to get excited about
travelling 514 miles on a Tuesday night for a mid-table clash against a team
you've played three times already in the past year.</p>
<p>With our proposal, no team outside the top tier would play regular league
fixtures against clubs at the other end of the country. While some clubs might
feel a loss of status by no longer playing in a national league, the top two
tiers would contain 54 clubs. Small clubs would suddenly find themselves in the
second tier, with the added prestige that would bring.</p>
<p>Small clubs can suddenly start to dream that one good season will take them to
the Premier League. We can end the stratification of Scottish football and the
inequities it creates. We can provide more opportunities for young Scottish
footballers to play at the top level, honing their skills to better serve the
national team.</p>
<p>In this document, we will set out how all of this can be achieved, if we dare to
take the bold steps required.</p>

<h2>The Pyramid</h2>
<p>We propose that there should be a pyramid of leagues in Scotland, with the
Premier League at its apex. Below that there should be a second tier consisting
of two leagues. These could be called the Northern and Southern Leagues, or
Highland and Lowland Leagues, or anything else that people are happy with. Each
of these two leagues would have two feeder leagues below it, giving a third tier
of four leagues.</p>
<h3>The Premier League</h3>
<p>We propose that this would have 18 teams, though 20 would also be a possibility.
Each team would play each other team twice, making a total of 34 games each (38
if we go with 20 teams). The bottom three teams would be relegated each season,
and would be replaced by the winners of the two second-tier leagues plus the
winner of a playoff involving those leagues' 2nd and 3rd placed teams.</p>
<p>A frequently-cited argument against such a large league is that it provides only
two Celtic-Rangers derby matches each season compared to the current four, a
potential deal-breaker for broadcasters. If four Celtic-Rangers derbies are a
must, we can have extra fixtures between teams close to each other in the final
standings.</p>
<p>Every season, the teams who finished 1st and 2nd last season play an extra two
games against each other, the same with 3rd and 4th, 5th and 6th etc. This would
take us to 36 games. We could expand this slightly and make it 1st/2nd/3rd,
4th/5th/6th etc. This would give 38 games a season, and simplify questions
around how to split up the newly-promoted teams.</p>
<p>By basing this off of the previous season's standings, we can spread these
matches throughout the season and avoid any public safety issues arising from a
Celtic-Rangers title decider. This does raise an issue that some teams
will have harder fixture lists than others, but as this would provide a slight
advantage to the weaker teams it would serve to make the league more
competitive. It would also create more top-of-the-table clashes and more
relegation six-pointers. More games that matter, fewer games that don't.</p>
<h3>Tier Two</h3>
<p>In this tier, we have two leagues - for the sake of argument let's call them the
North/South divisions. Each league again has 18 or 20 teams. The winner of each
league gains automatic promotion, 2nd and 3rd go into a four-team playoff for
the final promotion place. As with the Premier League, the bottom three teams
are automatically relegated.</p>
<p>This creates a problem for maintaining a constant league size: if a Northern
team wins the playoff but three Southern teams get relegated, that's a net gain
of two teams in the Southern Division, and a net loss of two in the Northern.
This can be resolved in the promotion structure from the leagues below. More on
that in the section on Tier Three.</p>
<p>Based on current form, the Southern Division might have Greenock Morton at the
top and Albion Rovers at the bottom, while the Northern Division could have
Montrose at the top and Huntly at the bottom. Note that the bottom Southern team
is currently much higher in the existing pyramid than the bottom Northern team -
this reflects the historic bias of the SFL/SPFL towards having more central belt
teams with most northern teams competing in the Highland league.</p>
<h3>Tier Three</h3>
<p>Tier Three would consist of four leagues - a Northeastern, Northwestern,
Southeastern and Southwestern league. The top teams at this level would be teams
which are currently below the SPFL League Two, and so it would make sense for
these leagues to be administered separately from the top two tiers, and also for
each of the four regions to be administered separately from the others. This is
covered in more detail in the section on Governance.</p>
<p>The rest of this section deals with some of the slightly complicated mechanics
around promotion and relegation and keeping the leagues balanced. For readers
not interested in these finer points, this part can be skipped.</p>
<p>As the third tier absorbs teams relegated from, and provides teams for promotion
to, the second tier, it has an important function to perform in keeping the
league size constant at that level. Each of the Northern and Southern Divisions
will have three teams relegated out, one or two teams promoted out, and anywhere
between zero and three teams relegated in - meaning they will need anywhere
between one and five teams to be promoted in to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>In order to support this, playoffs should be played between the two 1st-placed,
the two 2nd-placed, and the two 3rd-placed teams from the leagues that feed into
each of the Northern and Southern Divisions. This would result in a ranking from
1st to 6th and allow the appropriate one, two, three, four or five teams to be
awarded promotion, depending on what happens between tiers one and two.</p>
<p>Each regional football association would have to design a league structure which
can handle the variation that can arise from having anywhere between zero and
three teams relegated in, and anywhere between zero and three teams promoted
out. This might involve having a league with a variable size, or again having
variable promotion requirements from the tier below.</p>

<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>In order to administer the various competitions involved in this new league
structure, various organisations would need to exist. The existing
administrators of the SFA and SPFL will have an idea of how the finer points of
this will be carried out, but here we will set out a high-level overview of the
organisations and responsibilities involved.</p>
<h3>The Scottish Football Pyramid</h3>
<p>The Scottish Football Pyramid (<strong>SFP</strong>) would replace the existing Scottish
Professional Football League (<strong>SPFL</strong>), and would have responsibility for the
governance of the top two tiers of league football. At the end of each season,
they will relegate three teams each from the Northern and Southern Divisions,
and organise promotion playoffs involving the 12 promotion candidates provided
by the four regional leagues in the third tier.</p>
<h3>The regional football associations</h3>
<p>In the third tier, the pyramid has four different regions. Each of these would
have a regional football association (<strong>RFA</strong>). Every single club in the pyramid
would be a member of one of these <strong>RFA</strong>s. This means every club has a very
clear destination when being relegated from either the first or second tier.</p>
<p>Each <strong>RFA</strong> has responsibility for administering their own league autonomously,
in whatever way they see fit. The only requirement is that they produce 1st,
2nd and 3rd placed teams as promotion candidates at the end of each season, and
that they accept between zero and three of those teams back into their league
the following season, along with between zero and three relegated teams from
above.</p>
<p>Managing the challenges that come with that variability is the responsibility of
the <strong>RFA</strong>. The question of whether there are other tiers below the third in
any given region, and the responsibility for administering these leagues, is
entirely down to the <strong>RFA</strong> in question.</p>

<h2>Cup Competitions</h2>
<p>While this restructure would not necessitate any change in the structure of the
cup competitions, the creation of clear regions might provide some opportunities
to create a more interesting ecosystem of cup competitions.</p>
<h3>A Regionalised League Cup</h3>
<p>If we have four separate Regional Football Associations (<strong>RFA</strong>s), and every
club is a member of one of these, then we can use this to structure the early
rounds of the League Cup. In fact, we can allow each <strong>RFA</strong> to conduct their
own regional cup at the start of the season, providing a winner to then compete
in the League Cup proper.</p>
<p>This would give us four regional champions, plus the European qualifiers, who
would sit out the regional cups. At present, this would add up to eight teams
which would fit nicely into a cup format, but in the event of Scotland gaining
an extra European place, the lowest-seeded European qualifier could be required
to play a playoff against the winners of their region - or alternatively simply
the two lowest-seeded of the nine clubs could play a playoff round.</p>
<p>Conducting the early rounds of the League Cup in this way would provide clubs
with a chance of winning some early season silverware, as well as the
opportunity to play some local matches in the summer evenings. As the regional
cups would be minor trophies, the finals would not need to be played at neutral
grounds. This could even be used as an opportunity to experiment with "Davis Cup
rules" for home advantage - whoever had home advantage last time the teams met
in the competition, they are away this time.</p>
<h3>An anti-regionalised Scottish Cup</h3>
<p>The one time football fans really want to travel to the other side of the
country is for a one-off match, to see their team face an opposition they've
never met before. Regionalising the early stages of the League Cup might reduce
some of these opportunities, and to compensate we could modify the Scottish Cup
draw procedures so that in the early rounds (i.e. before the Premier League
teams enter), clubs from the same region cannot be drawn together. This would
guarantee fans of small clubs an interesting tie in the Scottish Cup, against a
club they do not normally face in league or League Cup action.</p>

<h2>Benefits Of This Structure</h2>
<h3>The National Team</h3>
<p>In 1998, the Scottish Premier League was born. It was supposed to launch
Scottish football into a new era of untold wealth and international television
audiences.</p>
<p>While that bright future has scarcely materialised for our clubs, Scottish
football fans have come to remember 1998 much more clearly as the year when the
men's national team competed in a major tournament finals for the last time in
at least two generations of footballers. Barry Ferguson, James McFadden, Darren
Fletcher and so many others have all come and gone without once having the
opportunity to compete on a major stage internationally.</p>
<p>Could it be that our grand plan to enrich a few of our clubs by excluding the
rest, has restricted opportunities for young Scottish players to compete at the
highest level our leagues can muster? We talk a lot about elite pathways, but
elite footballers do not always emerge in their early teens. Our most successful
player of this generation was playing at amateur side Queen's Park as a
19-year-old. 18 teams instead of 12 playing at the top level would provide 50%
more opportunities for Scottish players to gain experience at this level. </p>
<h3>Increased Variety</h3>
<p>Under the current structure, each team plays every other team in the league four
times a season. This becomes repetitive and dull for fans, and fans
overwhelmingly want larger leagues with only two games a season against each
team. This structure satisifes that demand, providing fans with increased
variety and less repetition.</p>
<h3>More Local Fixtures</h3>
<p>Outside of the top tier, the regionalisation of the leagues will provide more
local fixtures for smaller clubs; reducing travel costs and enhancing gate
receipts through increased away supports. Clubs are more likely to compete in
the same league as their local rivals, providing regular derby matches which
capture the imagination of their communities.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Stratification</h3>
<p>Scottish football is currently stratified in several different tiers. With our
proposal, a club like Arbroath might find themselves in the same league as
Huntly. Their supporters might balk at this idea - after all, they are at
present a much bigger club than Huntly. But is there really such a difference?
Are Arbroath three tiers above Huntly because they are a much better team, or
are they a much better team because they are three tiers higher?</p>
<p>The current structure restricts opportunities to play at a high level to only a
small number of clubs. It creates a hierarchy and inequality that reduces
competition, creates repetition and sucks the life out of the sport.</p>
<p>If clubs which are currently separated by multiple layers of promotion and
relegation were to suddenly find themselves in the same league, there would
doubtless be a wide gulf in quality to begin with, but over time the better
players would be spread around more clubs, with more novice players gaining the
opportunity to play alongside and learn from them.</p>

<h2>An Illustration</h2>
<p>Suppose we were to put this structure in place for the 2020/21 season, based off
of the current standings in the SPFL (and Highland League). What would that look
like?</p>
<h3>Premier League</h3>
<p>The following teams would compete in the new Premier League, in addition to the
existing 12 Premiership clubs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dundee United</li>
<li>Inverness Caledonian Thistle</li>
<li>Dundee</li>
<li>Ayr United</li>
<li>Arbroath</li>
<li>Dunfermline</li>
</ul>
<p>If the decision was made to include extra matches between teams who finished
close to each other in the previous season, then there could be an extra two
matches between each pair of teams in the following sets of three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celtic, Rangers, Motherwell</li>
<li>Aberdeen, Livingston, St Johnstone</li>
<li>Hibernian, Kilmarnock, St Mirren</li>
<li>Ross County, Hamilton Academical, Heart of Midlothian</li>
<li>Dundee United, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Dundee</li>
<li>Ayr United, Arbroath, Dunfermline</li>
</ul>
<p>If we assume that the final league table ends up the same as their present
standing, then Ayr United, Arbroath and Dunfermline would be automatically
relegated. Arbroath would go into the Northern League for the following season,
while Ayr United and Dunfermline would go into the Southern League.</p>
<h3>Southern League</h3>
<p>The inaugural season of the Southern League would be contested between the
following 18 clubs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greenock Morton</li>
<li>Alloa Athletic</li>
<li>Queen of the South</li>
<li>Partick Thistle</li>
<li>Raith Rovers</li>
<li>Falkirk</li>
<li>Airdrieonians</li>
<li>East Fife</li>
<li>Dumbarton</li>
<li>Clyde</li>
<li>Stranraer</li>
<li>Edinburgh City</li>
<li>Cowdenbeath</li>
<li>Queen's Park</li>
<li>Stirling Albion</li>
<li>Annan Athletic</li>
<li>Stenhousemuir</li>
<li>Albion Rovers</li>
</ul>
<p>If the final league table reflected the current standings, then Greenock Morton
would gain automatic promotion as champions, while Alloa Athletic and Queen of
the South would go into a promotion playoff. Annan Athletic, Stenhousemuir and
Albion Rovers would be relegated.</p>
<h3>Northern League</h3>
<p>The following clubs would be placed in the new Northern League:</p>
<ul>
<li>Montrose</li>
<li>Peterhead</li>
<li>Forfar Athletic</li>
<li>Cove Rangers</li>
<li>Elgin City</li>
<li>Brechin City</li>
<li>Brora Rangers</li>
<li>Inverurie Loco Works</li>
<li>Fraserburgh</li>
<li>Rothes</li>
<li>Buckie Thistle</li>
<li>Formartine United</li>
<li>Forres Mechanics</li>
<li>Nairn County</li>
<li>Keith</li>
<li>Wick Academy</li>
<li>Deveronvale</li>
<li>Huntly</li>
</ul>
<p>If the final league table ended up in that order, then Montrose would be
automatically promoted as champions, while Peterhead and Forfar Athletic would
go into a promotion playoff. Wick Academy, Deveronvale and Huntly would be
relegated.</p>
<h3>Promotion Playoffs</h3>
<p>This would be contested between Alloa Athletic and Queen of the South from the
Southern League, and Peterhead and Forfar Athletic from the Northern League. We
might expect this to be won by Alloa Athletic, as the team currently highest in
the SPFL table. In this case both the Northern and Southern Leagues would need
three teams to be promoted in from below, as they would each have had the same
number of teams relegated in as promoted out.</p>
<p>No playoff would be required between 1st-placed teams and 3rd-placed teams from
the third tier. It is an open question whether this means they would be
cancelled, or if they would be played in advance in any case just in case they
are needed. The 2nd-placed teams from the two Northern Leagues and from the two
Southern Leagues would play each other to determine who should be promoted into
the second tier.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>This document is not meant to set in stone how a restructured Scottish fooball
pyramid would have to look. Many questions are left open, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the leagues have 18 or 20 teams (or more)?</li>
<li>What should the regions be called, and how should they be defined?</li>
<li>Should the Premier League have extra matches among teams close to each other
  in the standings?</li>
<li>Should the cup competitions be restructured as well as the leagues?</li>
</ul>
<p>The intention of the document is to demonstrate that these competing interests
can be accomodated if we are willing to think creatively. We can provide the
benefits of larger leagues and greater variety of matches, while still
satisfying the requirements of broadcasters. We can eradicate the needless cost
of small clubs travelling the length of the country for relatively unimportant
league games.</p>
<p>The real question that remains is this: can the clubs agree to a bold and
ambitious transformation along these lines? We believe that they can, as we
believe there is something in here for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the broadcasters, we can continue to provide four Rangers-Celtic league
  derbies every season</li>
<li>For the biggest Premiership clubs, there is an opportunity to still play
  two home games each against Rangers and Celtic, if they can secure a top-three
  finish in the league</li>
<li>For the smaller Premiership clubs, there is the increased security of an
  enlarged league where only 15th place is required to avoid relegation, rather
  than 10th</li>
<li>For the Premiership/Championship yoyo clubs, the increased league size means
  more seasons spent in the top tier</li>
<li>For the Championship/League One sides who have always been just a little bit
  too small to realistically chase promotion to the Premiership, that dream is
  now very much within reach</li>
<li>For the League One/League Two sides, they can now consistently compete in the
  second tier of Scottish football, with the knowledge that one good season can
  see them promoted to the Premier League</li>
<li>For the Highland/Lowland League clubs and the Junior clubs skeptical of
  whether the pyramid really is the future of Scottish football, we show them
  that it absolutely is</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that this document will be read and seriously considered by the
decision-makers on the boards of clubs across the country, that every idea put
forward here will spark a thousand more, and that we can move forward into a new
decade with genuine ambition for what Scottish football can become. In these
difficult and uncertain times, we must be creative. We owe it to the future of
the sport we all love.</p>
